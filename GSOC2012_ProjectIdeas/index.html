<h2 id="implement-left-hand-traffic">Implement <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-hand_traffic">left-hand traffic</a></h2>

<p>SUMO uses right-hand traffic and therefore presents obstacles when simulating traffic in many parts of the world.</p>

<h2 id="implement-gui-frontends-for-some-of-the-command-line-only-applications">Implement GUI-frontends for some of the command-line-only applications</h2>

<p>The use of command-line applications presents a steep learning curve to many users. Even a generic tool for setting options may be of great help.</p>

<h2 id="enhance-capabilities-of-the-simulation-viewer">Enhance Capabilities of the Simulation Viewer</h2>

<p>The <a href="/SUMO-GUI" title="wikilink">SUMO-GUI</a> application depends on configuration files. Since editing configuration files is difficult for many users, <a href="/SUMO-GUI" title="wikilink">SUMO-GUI</a> should provide for a mechanism to load the required files via menus.</p>

<h2 id="implement-a-movement-model-for-pedestrians">Implement a movement model for pedestrians</h2>

<p>Right now, SUMO can account for pedestrians when simulating inter-modal traffic. However, the model is quite coarse. The time for crossing roads is not modelled. Also, there is no flow model for crowded side walks.</p>

<p>If you are planning to work with SUMO in your bachelor or masters thesis, what extra feature do you need to get started?</p>
