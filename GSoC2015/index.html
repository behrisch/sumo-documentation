<p><a href="https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2015/help_page#1._How_does_a_mentoring_organization">Here is the list of steps for the application.</a> This page should answer all the questions on the list which need more than yes/no or a list of names</p>

<h2 id="describe-your-organization">Describe your organization.</h2>

<h2 id="why-do-we-apply">Why do we apply</h2>

<ul>
  <li>outreach</li>
  <li>gain more developers</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ideas-list">Ideas list</h2>

<p><em>At a minimum, all the ideas on your Ideas List should include the expected outcome of the project, a potential mentor, the skills and/or languages required to complete the project, and a general “difficulty” level.</em></p>

<h3 id="implementing-macroscopic-assignment-models">Implementing macroscopic assignment models</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Goal: Have more than just iterative assignment (At least Lohse etc.)</li>
  <li>Mentor: <a href="/Behrisch" title="wikilink">Behrisch</a></li>
  <li>Skills: C++, some math</li>
  <li>Difficulty: medium</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="vissim-importer">VISSIM importer</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Convert at least basic VISSIM networks from recent versions into the SUMO format</li>
  <li>Mentor: <a href="/Behrisch" title="wikilink">Behrisch</a></li>
  <li>Skills: C++, XML</li>
  <li>Difficulty: medium</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="application-launcher">Application Launcher</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Currently, the command line must be used frequently when preparing a simulation. To make life easier for many users, a launcher application for setting options and selecting input files via dialogs should be created. A wizard-type interface should be added to streamline common tasks.</li>
  <li>Mentor: <a href="/namdre" title="wikilink">namdre</a></li>
  <li>Skills: python</li>
  <li>Difficulty: medium (easy, if experience with GUI frameworks exists)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="intersection-analysis">Intersection analysis</h3>

<p>Smartphone app (android, of course!) that can, from the position of the phone, compute the corresponding intersection geometry by using openstreetmap data, supported eventually by measurements from the phone itself (distances e.g.). It then writes these data to a SUMO simulation file, and has eventually the ability to collect additional traffic data. Can be done e.g. as a simple counting app, via the video-camera, the microphone, the magnetic field sensor,… (not all of these make sense, of course, other sensors might be more suitable)</p>

<p>In addition to that, it runs a truly fast queueing model on the phone itself to determine the optimal cycle time, green splits, delays, and the like. This, too, can be supported by measurements from the intersection, i.e. the saturation flows for the various connections.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mentor: <a href="/Behrisch" title="wikilink">Behrisch</a>, Peter Wagner</li>
  <li>Skills: Android development</li>
  <li>Difficulty: medium (easy, if only a frontend to sumo is built)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="left-hand-traffic">Left-hand traffic</h3>

<p>Currently, SUMO only simulates right-hand traffic and therefore cannot simulate some parts of the world.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mentor: <a href="/namdre" title="wikilink">namdre</a></li>
  <li>Skills: C++</li>
  <li>Difficulty: medium (need to be able to read and comprehend quite a bit of existing code)</li>
</ul>
