<h1 id="networks">Networks</h1>

<p><a href="/NETGENERATE" title="wikilink">NETGENERATE</a> allows to create networks in a very comfortable way. For some small-sized tests of rerouting strategies, tls-signals etc., this is probably the best - read “fastest” - solution to get a network one can run some simulations at. The clear naming of the streets also eases defining own routes. But networks generated using <a href="/NETGENERATE" title="wikilink">NETGENERATE</a> are of course useless as soon as you want to simulate a real-world network.</p>

<p>Using <a href="/NETCONVERT" title="wikilink">NETCONVERT</a> one can import road networks from several sources, among them VISUM, shape files, and OSM databases. This is of course the tool to use for setting up real-world networks.</p>

<p>Still, most examples within the data-section were written as XML files by hand and converted using <a href="/NETCONVERT" title="wikilink">NETCONVERT</a> for several reasons. At first, the examples are small enough and one may steer the output better than when using <a href="/NETGENERATE" title="wikilink">NETGENERATE</a>. Furthermore, defining own networks using XML-data is more flexible.</p>
