<p>The tools’ names accord to their function.</p>

<h1 id="routecheckpy">routecheck.py</h1>

<p>Allows to verify whether routes within the given route-file(s) are valid for the given network. Call(s):</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">routecheck.py </code><net>` `<vehicletypes>` [-f|--fix] `<routes>`+`</routes></vehicletypes></net></p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">routecheck.py </code><net>` `&lt;vehicletypes+routes&gt;</net></p>

<p>If a route is broken (a diconnected), the tool writes something like the following to cout:</p>

<p>If <strong>–fix</strong> (<strong>-f</strong>) is given, routes are tried to be repaired (assuming only one link is missing). The name of the output file(s) is generated by appending “.fixed”. These file contain repaired routes (if it was possible), each appended link is written in comments after the vehicle.</p>

<h2 id="known-caveats">Known caveats</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The tool does not deal with vehicle types; it only checks whether routes are connected</li>
  <li>When working in <strong>–fix</strong>-mode a vehicle type file must be given</li>
  <li>No tests for dealing with networks that have internal edges</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="routes_joinpy">routes_Join.py</h1>

<p>Joins routes belonging to two networks. A map file with the following syntax is read first:</p>

<EDGE_ID>`-&gt;`<EDGE_ID>

It describes at which edges the networks overlapped and which edge was kept in the resulting one. Vehicles from both given route files starting at the first of those edges will be at first not regarded, but their routes are kept in memory. All other vehicles are kept, but if they pass one of the mapped edges, the route is continued by choosing a random route from the list of previously discarded ones which start at the corresponding edge.

`routes_Join.py `&lt;prefix#1&gt;` `&lt;routes#1&gt;` `&lt;prefix#2&gt;` `&lt;routes#2&gt;` `<mapfile>

-   &lt;prefix#1&gt;: The prefix to use for vehicles from the first routes file
-   &lt;routes#1&gt;: The first routes file
-   &lt;prefix#2&gt;: The prefix to use for vehicles from the second routes file
-   &lt;routes#2&gt;: The second routes file
-   <mapfile>: The edge mapping

Attention! The routes are not sorted in time!

sort_routes.py
===============

This script sorts the vehicles in the given route file by their depart time. If the option is supplied, a slow but memory efficent algorithm is used.

`/tools/route/sort_routes.py input.rou.xml -o output.rou.xml`

cutRoutes.py
============

This script cuts down routes from a large scenario to a sub-scenario. This assumes the existence of a big scenario (*orig.net.xml* and *orig.rou.xml*). The goal is to simulate only a smaller part of the network (*reduced.net.xml*) keeping all of the routes that pass through the reduced network. Output can be a route file or a trip file. Depending on the given options the new departure times can be computed from exitTimes (see [SUMO](/SUMO "wikilink") option ), extrapolated from the original network or simply copied from the original departure times. If the option is supplied, a slow but memory efficent algorithm is used for sorting the output by departure time. Example usage

`/tools/route/cutRoutes.py reduced.net.xml orig.rou.xml --routes-output output.rou.xml --orig-net orig.net.xml`

routeStats.py
=============

Compute a length-histogram for all routes in a given route file. Alternatively, compute the difference in lengths for two route files with the same vehicles. Routes must be child elements of -elements. Output for plotting may also be generated (see ).

`/tools/route/routeStats.py myNet.net.xml myRoutes.rou.xml`

When setting option a histogram on departure times (or departure time differences) is generated instead.

route2poly.py
=============

Transform routes into polygons for visualization in [SUMO-GUI](/SUMO-GUI "wikilink"). Using the options the colors can be controlled. Each of these options supports values from \[0, 1\] as well as the special value *random*.

`/tools/route/route2poly.py myNet.net.xml myRoutes.rou.xml`

route2sel.py
============

Transform routes into an edge selection file which contains all edges used in any of the routes, trips or person plans. This file may be used for visualization in [SUMO-GUI](/SUMO-GUI "wikilink") or pruning a network via [NETCONVERT](/NETCONVERT "wikilink").

`/tools/route2sel.py myRoutes.rou.xml -o usedEdges.txt`

`netconvert --net-file myNet.net.xml --keep-edges.input-file usedEdges.txt --output reduced.net.xml`

route_departOffset
===================

Shifts the departure times of , , and elements by a specified amount. When setting the option , only vehicles that depart on one of the given edges are affected.

`/tools/route/route_departOffset.py --input-file myRoutes.rou.xml --output-file shifted.rou.xml --depart-offset 900`

The option shifts all departures within the interval \[a,b\[ to the interval \[c,d\[.

`/tools/route/route_departOffset.py --input-file myRoutes.rou.xml --output-file shifted.rou.xml --depart-interval 3600,7200,0,500`

showDepartsAndArrivalsPerEdge
=============================

Generates a visualization file for investigating traffic patterns in a route file.

`/tools/showDepartsAndArrivalsPerEdge.py myRoutes.rou.xml --output-file results.xml`

The generated file *result.xml* can be loaded in [SUMO-GUI](/SUMO-GUI "wikilink") using the following options

` sumo-gui --weights-file result.xml --weight-attribute departed -n myNet.net.xml`

The number of departures for each edge can the be used for coloring the edges by changing the edge visualization settings to color *by loaded weight*. Alternatively the option may be used to color by arrivals.

When investigating routes that pass a particular edge or intersection, the input routes may be filtered using the option :

` ``/tools/showDepartsAndArrivalsPerEdge.py myRoutes.rou.xml --output-file results.xml --subpart edge3,edge4,edge5`

This will only generate results for routes that contain the edge sequence *edge3 edge4 edge5*.

addStops2Routes.py
==================

To declare a vehicle that stops in a parkingArea, a <stop>-definition must be part of the vehicle or it's route. This script adds stops to routes.

`/tools/addStops2Routes.py -r `<route-file>` -p `<parking-areas>` -d `<duration in="" seconds="">` [-o `<output-file>`]`

Stops in one or more parking areas (seperated by comma) are added to the vehicles route, if they are part of the vehicles id. Example:

    <routes>
       <vehicle id="0_parkingAreaA" depart="0">
          <route edges="e1 e2 e3" />
       </vehicle>
    </routes>

`/tools/route/addStops2Routes.py -r `<route-file>` -p ParkingAreaA -d 3600 [-o `<output-file>`]`

    <routes>
       <vehicle id="0_parkingAreaA" depart="0">
          <route edges="e1 e2 e3" />
          <stop parkingArea="parkingAreaA" duration="3600">
       &lt;/vehicle&gt;
    &lt;/routes&gt;

Note, that the lane of that parking area must belong to one of the edges “e1, e2, e3” of the vehicles route.
