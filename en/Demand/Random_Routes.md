[DUAROUTER](/DUAROUTER "wikilink") and [JTRROUTER](/JTRROUTER "wikilink") used to generate random routes for a given road network with the option (or for short). Due to a number of bugs in this feature and because those routes are highly unrealistic, this behavior was replaced with a python [random trip generation](/Tools/Trip#randomTrips.py "wikilink") script which can also produce a route set employing the [DUAROUTER](/DUAROUTER "wikilink").
