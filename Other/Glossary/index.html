    <h2 id="a">A</h2>

<p>application :An application is a computer program, herein, an “application” mostly means one of the main, compiled programs that are included in the SUMO package.
additional-file :A file that can be included in a sumo configuration. This is needed to load pois, shapes, bus stops and variable speed signs. Refer to <a href="/SUMO#Format_of_additional_files" title="wikilink">the format description</a> for details.</p>

<h2 id="c">C</h2>

<p>connection(s)-file :An XML-file describing connections between edges or lanes, see <a href="/Networks/Building_Networks_from_own_XML-descriptions#Connection_Descriptions" title="wikilink">connection descriptions for importing networks defined as XML</a></p>

<h2 id="d">D</h2>

<p>DELPHI :Deutschlandweite Echtzeit Verkehrs-Lage und Prognose im Ereignisfall
destination :The position of the end of a vehicle journey. Mostly a TAZ processed by OD2TRIPs within which a “sink” edge lies
detector :An artificial device for object (mainly vehicle) states recognition and/or logging
DFD :Deutsches Fernerkundungsdatenzentrum des DLR
district :see TAZ
DLR :Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt
DUA :Dynamic User Assignment
DUE :Dynamic User Equilibrium</p>

<h2 id="e">E</h2>

<p>edge :A single-directed street connection between two points (junctions/nodes). An edge contains at least one lane
edge(s)-file :A XML-file describing edges of a road network, see <a href="/Networks/Building_Networks_from_own_XML-descriptions#Edge_Descriptions" title="wikilink">edge descriptions for importing networks defined as XML</a></p>

<h2 id="f">F</h2>

<p>FCD :Floating Car Data</p>

<h2 id="i">I</h2>

<p>induction loop: A detector placed on a certain position on a lane which recognizes vehicles passing it and logs their attributes (speed, size, etc.)</p>

<h2 id="j">J</h2>

<p>junction :The place an edge begins or ends at (same as node)
junction logic :The part of a junction which determines the vehicle behaviour at the according junction by using certain right-of-way - rules</p>

<h2 id="l">L</h2>

<p>link :A connection between two lanes within a junction. Within microsim, each lane has links (connections) to the following lanes. A link contains the information whether the vehicle has to decelerate in front of the junction.</p>

<h2 id="m">M</h2>

<p>macroscopic :In a macroscopic traffic (flow) simulation, the atomic instances are roads; the flow is simulated directly (see microscopic)
mesoscopic :In a mesoscopic traffic (flow) simulation, the streets are partitioned into sections which multiple vehicles may enter and leave at each simulation step
microscopic :In a microscopic traffic (flow) simulation, the atomic instances are vehicles; the flow is simulated by simulating the vehicles (see macroscopic)
multimodal :A multimodal traffic simulation is capable of processing different types of traffic (busses, trains, vehicles etc.)</p>

<h2 id="n">N</h2>

<p>(street) network :In our terms, a network is the combination of junctions (nodes) and edges (streets)
node :A node (junction) is a single point were at least one edge (road) starts or ends
node(s)-file :A XML-file describing nodes of a road network, see <a href="/Networks/Building_Networks_from_own_XML-descriptions#Node_Descriptions" title="wikilink">node descriptions for importing networks defined as XML</a></p>

<h2 id="o">O</h2>

<p>O/D-matrix (od-matrix) :Origin/Destination-matrix; describes how many vehicles are moving from each origin to each destination within a certain time period
option :A parameter for the application which determines what or how an application shall do
origin :The position of the begin of a vehicle journey. Mostly a TAZ processed by OD2TRIPs within which a “source” edge lies</p>

<h2 id="p">P</h2>

<p>poi :short for “point of interest”; A position of an object that may be interesting</p>

<h2 id="r">R</h2>

<p>route :A route is a complete description of a vehicle’s path over the network; it contains the information when the vehicle departs (the route starts) and over which edges the vehicle shall drive</p>

<h2 id="s">S</h2>

<p>script :A small computer program which normally doees not have to be compiled. The SUMO package includes several scripts, most written in Python
source :A source means a place at which vehicles are inserted into the street network
source-tar-ball : A file containing the sources (program code) for a project. The source code must be compiled in order to get the runnable application. It is called “tar-ball” because of using the application “tar” to join all the source files into a single file.
submicroscopic :In a submicroscopic traffic (flow) simulation, the atomic instances are parts of the vehicle or the driver (gearing or behavior is modelled)</p>

<h2 id="t">T</h2>

<p>TAZ:Traffic Assignment Zone, <a href="/Demand/Importing_O/D_Matrices#Describing_the_TAZ" title="wikilink">a collection of edges describing a part of a road network’s area</a> (also called ‘district’)
TLS:traffic lights system
trip :A reduced information about a vehicle’s movement; contains only the departure time, the begin, and the end edge. Must be transformed into a route using a router for being used within the simulation
trip-table (trip list) :A file containing several trips
TS :Institute of Transportation Systems at the German Aerospace Center (DLR)
TS-BS :TS Standort Braunschweig
TS-BA :TS Standort Berlin-Adlershof
type(s)-file :A XML-file describing types of streets, see <a href="/Networks/Building_Networks_from_own_XML-descriptions#Type_Descriptions" title="wikilink">type descriptions for importing networks defined as XML</a></p>

<h2 id="x">X</h2>

<p>XML :“e<strong>X</strong>tensible <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage is a universal format for structured documents and data” as the w3c says. Further information may be found at <a href="http://www.w3c.org/XML/">http://www.w3c.org/XML/</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML</a>. Most of the data read and written by SUMO is stored as XML, see also the page on <a href="/Other/File_Extensions" title="wikilink">file types</a>.
XSD :<strong>X</strong>ML <strong>S</strong>chema <strong>D</strong>efinitions “… provide a means for defining the structure, content and semantics of XML documents” as the w3c says. Further information may be found at <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema">http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Schema_%28W3C%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Schema_%28W3C%29</a>. A part of the XML data formats used by SUMO is covered by xsd, see the page on <a href="/Other/File_Extensions" title="wikilink">file types</a>.</p>
