<p>DELPHI :Deutschlandweite Echtzeit Verkehrs-Lage und Prognose im Ereignisfall
destination :The position of the end of a vehicle journey. Mostly a TAZ processed by OD2TRIPs within which a “sink” edge lies

<p>edge :A single-directed street connection between two points (junctions/nodes). An edge contains at least one lane
edge(s)-file :A XML-file describing edges of a road network, see <a href="/Networks/Building_Networks_from_own_XML-descriptions#Edge_Descriptions" title="wikilink">edge descriptions for importing networks defined as XML</a></p>

<p>induction loop: A detector placed on a certain position on a lane which recognizes vehicles passing it and logs their attributes (speed, size, etc.)</p>

<h2 id="j">J</h2>

<p>junction :The place an edge begins or ends at (same as node)
junction logic :The part of a junction which determines the vehicle behaviour at the according junction by using certain right-of-way - rules</p>

<h2 id="l">L</h2>

<p>link :A connection between two lanes within a junction. Within microsim, each lane has links (connections) to the following lanes. A link contains the information whether the vehicle has to decelerate in front of the junction.</p>

<h2 id="m">M</h2>

<p>macroscopic :In a macroscopic traffic (flow) simulation, the atomic instances are roads; the flow is simulated directly (see microscopic)
mesoscopic :In a mesoscopic traffic (flow) simulation, the streets are partitioned into sections which multiple vehicles may enter and leave at each simulation step
microscopic :In a microscopic traffic (flow) simulation, the atomic instances are vehicles; the flow is simulated by simulating the vehicles (see macroscopic)
multimodal :A multimodal traffic simulation is capable of processing different types of traffic (busses, trains, vehicles etc.)</p>

<h2 id="n">N</h2>

<p>(street) network :In our terms, a network is the combination of junctions (nodes) and edges (streets)
node :A node (junction) is a single point were at least one edge (road) starts or ends
node(s)-file :A XML-file describing nodes of a road network, see <a href="/Networks/Building_Networks_from_own_XML-descriptions#Node_Descriptions" title="wikilink">node descriptions for importing networks defined as XML</a></p>

<h2 id="o">O</h2>

<p>O/D-matrix (od-matrix) :Origin/Destination-matrix; describes how many vehicles are moving from each origin to each destination within a certain time period
option :A parameter for the application which determines what or how an application shall do
origin :The position of the begin of a vehicle journey. Mostly a TAZ processed by OD2TRIPs within which a “source” edge lies</p>

<h2 id="p">P</h2>

<p>poi :short for “point of interest”; A position of an object that may be interesting</p>

<h2 id="r">R</h2>

<p>route :A route is a complete description of a vehicle’s path over the network; it contains the information when the vehicle departs (the route starts) and over which edges the vehicle shall drive</p>

<h2 id="s">S</h2>

<p>script :A small computer program which normally doees not have to be compiled. The SUMO package includes several scripts, most written in Python
source :A source means a place at which vehicles are inserted into the street network
source-tar-ball : A file containing the sources (program code) for a project. The source code must be compiled in order to get the runnable application. It is called “tar-ball” because of using the application “tar” to join all the source files into a single file.
submicroscopic :In a submicroscopic traffic (flow) simulation, the atomic instances are parts of the vehicle or the driver (gearing or behavior is modelled)</p>

<h2 id="t">T</h2>

<p>XML :“e<strong>X</strong>tensible <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage is a universal format for structured documents and data” as the w3c says.
