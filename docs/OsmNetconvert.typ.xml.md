Default SUMO edge type file for importing OpenStreetMap files. It contains the edge type configuration for roads outside of towns and located in Germany. If you want to import such an OpenStreetMap file, you can use this file as is. In some rare cases, you might want to consider modified values for some edge types though. See [SUMO edge type file](/SUMO_edge_type_file "wikilink") for an explanation of the file's content.
