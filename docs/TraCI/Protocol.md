This page details the [TraCI](/TraCI "wikilink") protocol. Please see there for a general introduction.

Basic Flow
----------

After starting [SUMO](/SUMO "wikilink"), clients connect to [SUMO](/SUMO "wikilink") by setting up a TCP connection to the appointed [SUMO](/SUMO "wikilink") port. TraCI supports multiple clients and executes all commands of a client in a sequence until it issues the [TraCI/Control-related commands\#Command 0x02: Simulation Step](/TraCI/Control-related_commands#Command_0x02:_Simulation_Step "wikilink") command. In order to have a predefined execution order every client should issue a [TraCI/Control-related commands\#Command 0x03: SetOrder](/TraCI/Control-related_commands#Command_0x03:_SetOrder "wikilink") command before the first simulation step. It assigns a number to the client and commands from different clients during the same simulation step will be executed in the order of that numbering (which does not need to be consecutive nor positive but unique). When using multi client setups the number of clients needs to be known when starting SUMO and all clients need to connect before the first simulation step.

The client application sends commands to [SUMO](/SUMO "wikilink") to control the simulation run, to influence single vehicle's behavior or to ask for environmental details. [SUMO](/SUMO "wikilink") answers with a <em>Status</em>-response to each command and additional results that depend on the given command.

The client has to trigger each simulation step in [SUMO](/SUMO "wikilink") using the [TraCI/Control-related commands\#Command 0x02: Simulation Step](/TraCI/Control-related_commands#Command_0x02:_Simulation_Step "wikilink") command. If any [subscriptions](/TraCI/Object_Variable_Subscription "wikilink") have been done, the subscribed values are returned. The simulation will advance to the next once all clients have sent the simulation step command. Currently all clients receive all subscription results (even if the subscription has been issued by a different client).

The client is responsible for shutting down the connection using the [close](/TraCI/Control-related_commands#Command_0x7F:_Close "wikilink") command. See [Simulation/Basic Definition\#Defining the Time Period to Simulate](/Simulation/Basic_Definition#Defining_the_Time_Period_to_Simulate "wikilink") for further information on differences between running the simulation in TraCI-mode. When all clients issued close, the simulation will end, freeing all resources.

Messages
--------

A TCP message acts as container for a list of commands or results. Therefore, each TCP message consists of a small header that gives the overall message size and a set of commands that are put behind it. The length and identifier of each command is placed in front of the command. A scheme of this container is depicted below:

` 0                 7 8               15`
`+--------------------------------------+`
`| Message Length including this header |`
`+--------------------------------------+`
`|      (Message Length, continued)     |`
`+--------------------------------------+  \`
`|     Length        |    Identifier    |  |`
`+--------------------------------------+   > Command_0`
`|           Command_0 content          |  |`
`+--------------------------------------+  /`
`                   ...`
`+--------------------------------------+  \`
`|     Length        |    Identifier    |  |`
`+--------------------------------------+   > Command_n-1`
`|          Command_n-1 content         |  |`
`+--------------------------------------+  /`

In some cases the length of a single command may not suffice, since the maximum command length is limited to 255. In those cases an extended length can be used by setting the original ubyte length field to zero and adding an integer length field. This extended scheme for a command looks as follows:

` 0                 7 8               15`
`+--------------------------------------+  \`
`|   Length = 0      |                  |  |`
`+-------------------+                  |  |`
`|        32 bit Integer Length         |  |`
`|                   +------------------+   > Command`
`|                   |   Identifier     |  |`
`+--------------------------------------+  |`
`|            Command content           |  |`
`+--------------------------------------+  /`

To simplify the usage of TraCI, we provide a class for handling the socket connection and another for composing a message out of basic data types. The C++ implementation of these classes is available at , the Python implementation is in and . For a Java implementation have a look at [TraaS](http://traas.sourceforge.net/). The class `tcpip::Socket` handles a TCP connection on server as well as on client side. The class `tcpip::Storage` is designed to hold a list of elementary data types. By using the method `tcpip::Socket::sendExact(tcpip::Storage)` and `tcpip::Socket::receiveExact(Storage)`, messages can be send and received as Storage objects.

### Status Response

|        |             |
|:------:|:-----------:|
|  ubyte |    string   |
| Result | Description |

Each command is acknowledged by a status response, included are a *Result* and a *Description*. The identifier refers to the identifier of the respective command that is acknowledged.
*Result* can have the following values:

-   0x00 in case of succes
-   0xFF if the requested command failed
-   0x01 if the requested command is not implemented in the network simulator (in addition, a *Description* text must be added)
