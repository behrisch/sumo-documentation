Some people extended SUMO or built tools to make it more usable. Not all of these extensions have found its way to what we would call “SUMO core”.

Within SUMO
===========

The following extensions became a core part of the SUMO package.

**[TraCI](/TraCI "wikilink")**


online interaction with the simulation

Included in the Distribution
============================

The following contributions are included in the package, but are less supported.

**[Contributed/Cadyts](/Contributed/Cadyts "wikilink")**


a tool by Gunnar Flötteröd which adapts the simulate flows to the real flows in a known net

**[SUMOPy](/Contributed/SUMOPy "wikilink")**


a tool by Joerg Schweizer supporting the whole SUMO toolchain with a GUI especially for demand modelling

~~[Contributed/SUMO Traffic Modeler](/Contributed/SUMO_Traffic_Modeler "wikilink")~~


~~a graphical user interface for defining high-level traffic for SUMO~~ (obsolete)

External
========

The following extensions are managed and supported by other parties.

Demand Generators
-----------------

**[Citymob for Roadmaps](http://www.grc.upv.es/Software/c4r.html)**


mobility pattern generator for vehicular networks (VANet focus)

Scenario and Network Editors
----------------------------

**[eWorld](http://eworld.sourceforge.net/)**


an application that allows to convert and enrich roads networks

Connections to Network Simulators
---------------------------------

**[Veins](http://www7.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/veins/)**


connects SUMO to OMNeT++

**[<font color="#0174DF">Tra</font><font color="#FF0000">NS</font>](http://trans.epfl.ch/)**


connects SUMO to ns-2

**[MOVE](http://lens1.csie.ncku.edu.tw/wiki/doku.php?id=%E2%80%A7realistic_mobility_generator_for_vehicular_networks)**


connects SUMO to ns-2

**[VSimRTI](http://www.dcaiti.tu-berlin.de/research/simulation/)**


connects SUMO to OMNeT++ and JiST/SWANS

Purgatory
=========

The following extensions exist or have existed, but their state is unclear.

**[Contributed/iTranSIM](/Contributed/iTranSIM "wikilink")**


extension by online-calibration using induction loop data by Tino Morenz

**[Contributed/SmallMaps](/Contributed/SmallMaps "wikilink")**
