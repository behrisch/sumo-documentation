    -   fixed crash when specifying duplicate person ids.
-   NETCONVERT
    -   when adding sidewalks via [type-map](/SUMO_edge_type_file "wikilink") and a sidewalk already exists, the edge now remains unchanged.
    -   fixed bug where some generated pedestrian crossings at T-intersections had a permanent red light.
    -   fixed bug where right-turning vehicles had the green light during the left-turn phase when pedestrian crossings where present.

        -   repositioned internal junctions so that the waiting vehicles do not overlap with foe vehicles
        -   moved internal junctions at TLS-controlled nodes further towards the junction center (previously they respected foe vehicles which would never get the green light at the same time)
    -   fixed invalid junction logic (right-of-way rules) when incoming edges had uncommon angles.
    -   generate tls logic now matches the underlying edge priorities. The streams that would have priority if the node type was “priority” now always have a common green phase.

    -   Rerouters can now set permitted vehicle classes on closed lanes, see

    -   sidewalks can now be added for specific edges by adding the attribute to -elements in *.edg.xml*-files. This automatically remaps any existing connections.
    -   when using pedestrian crossings and green verges (lanes which disallow all vClasses), the crossing now starts at the side of the ride instead of the green verge.
    -   Added option . This adds sidewalks for edges that allow pedestrians on any of their lanes regardless of speed.
    -   Can now import waterways from OSM ([needs a custom type-map](http://sumo.dlr.de/trac.wsgi/browser/trunk/sumo/data/typemap/osmNetconvertShips.typ.xml)).
