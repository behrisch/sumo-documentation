<p>SUMO Traffic Modeler by Leontios Papaleontiou is a graphical application for setting up an activity-based demand. It is not longer developed by the original author, and as it has some interesting features, we included it into the release.</p>

<p>The tool is stored in a runnable .jar-file, you may simply double-click on it on Windows to start it - it requires Java 6 to be installed. <a href="/SUMO_Traffic_Modeler" title="wikilink">SUMO Traffic Modeler</a> is located in \bin.</p>

<p>There is not much documentation on it. What worked for me was:</p>

<ul>
  <li>on the command line
    <ul>
      <li>having a given road network, reimport it using <a href="/NETCONVERT" title="wikilink">NETCONVERT</a> and save plain XML definitions using the option. Make sure the prefix of the plain files is the same as the network’s name.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>start the SUMO Traffic Modeler by double-clicking on it</li>
  <li>generate a project
    <ul>
      <li>choose File-&gt;New Project…</li>
      <li>navigate to the folder the network/plain network definitions are located in for both, the project’s name and for the network description</li>
      <li>the network should appear</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>set-up demand
    <ul>
      <li>click on “Traffic Layers” in the tree located on the right side of the window</li>
      <li>add some demand definitions (“Flow”, “Area Flow”, “Hotspot”)</li>
      <li>you may alter the demands using the dialog on the right, bottom side of the window</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>export the demand/simulation
    <ul>
      <li>choose Simulation-&gt;Export…</li>
      <li>fill the dialog with some meaningful values</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>What you will obtain after those steps is a simulation configuration file. The files referenced within this configuration are not yet build. Even though <a href="/SUMO_Traffic_Modeler" title="wikilink">SUMO Traffic Modeler</a> has a menu for setting up the paths to <a href="/NETCONVERT" title="wikilink">NETCONVERT</a> and <a href="/DUAROUTER" title="wikilink">DUAROUTER</a>, both application are not executed automatically. Instead, you have to convert the trips generated by <a href="/SUMO_Traffic_Modeler" title="wikilink">SUMO Traffic Modeler</a> into routes by yourself on the command line. You may reuse the network you have used to set up <a href="/SUMO_Traffic_Modeler" title="wikilink">SUMO Traffic Modeler</a>, but you probably have to build it using the given edges/nodes files if you have pruned it during the work with <a href="/SUMO_Traffic_Modeler" title="wikilink">SUMO Traffic Modeler</a>.</p>

<p>If you convert the trips generated by <a href="/SUMO_Traffic_Modeler" title="wikilink">SUMO Traffic Modeler</a> into routes using <a href="/DUAROUTER" title="wikilink">DUAROUTER</a>, you may get the error “No connection between ‘…’ and ‘…’ found.”. To ignore it, call <a href="/DUAROUTER" title="wikilink">DUAROUTER</a> with .</p>
