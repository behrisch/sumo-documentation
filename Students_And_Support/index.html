    <p>Please find below a list of possible work items. It includes both, topics for long-term (3-6 months) academic theses and short-term things/issues of which we think that they would improve SUMO.</p>

<h1 id="master-bachelor-or-diploma-theses">Master, Bachelor, or Diploma Theses</h1>

<p>In the following, you may find ideas for student work - Bachelor, Master, or Diploma theses. The topics you may find below are those we are interested in and some of them are already covered by previous scientific work. We assume them to be relevant for extending the current state-of-the art in traffic science and information science.</p>

<p>In the case you are interested in one of the topics, we - the employees of the German Aerospace Center - would accompany, review and judge your work. Nonetheless, you will need an academic institution which will accept your work. This means, you normally have to contact your professor / advisor and ask him whether he will accept a topic. You should do this before starting the work on one of the topics. One of us will then act as the second reader/redactor and will guide you along your work. Of course, an initial discussion between the professor / advisor and us is wished for clarifying the work. Further regulations and legal issues are a matter of your home university / organisation.</p>

<p>The following list contains proposals only. If you have an own idea, you can present it to us, too. There is also <a href="/DiplomStudArb" title="wikilink">a more verbose list of the topics, in German</a>.</p>

<h1 id="other-issues">Other Issues</h1>

<p>In the following, you may find a list of tasks which are too short-termed or too well-elaborated for being a part of an academic work. They have to be done, but we could not find the time, yet, to work on them honestly. If you have some spare time, it would be very nice if you would invest it in one of them. Please contact us then for further details.</p>

<p>Also, some of the items are assumed to be a good base for short-term student topics, within seminars, or programming / software engineering courses. Evaluating models could for instance be done by a set of students, assigning one model per student, and the same would for example also count for routing algorithms. Extending the test suites would be a nice programming course topic, too.</p>

<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Converting our wiki-pages into PDFs</li>
  <li>Ideas/Designs for a documentation</li>
  <li>Improved search</li>
  <li>XML schemata for files</li>
  <li>a data catalogue for SUMO files</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="validation">Validation</h2>

<ul>
  <li>using real-world data (rather a topic for a seminar)</li>
  <li>using traffic engineering handbooks (rather a topic for a seminar)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="models">Models</h2>

<ul>
  <li>lane-change models evaluation (rather a topic for a seminar)</li>
  <li>car-following models evaluation (rather a topic for a seminar)</li>

<h2 id="routing">Routing</h2>

<ul>
  <li>other (A*, highway-hierarchies) routing algorithms (rather a topic for a seminar)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="interoperability">Interoperability</h2>

<ul>
  <li>interoperability with other publicly available tools</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tests">Tests</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Extend the unit-test - suite (would be a nice practical work for an according software engineering seminar)</li>
  <li>Extend the texttest - suite (would be a nice practical work for an according software engineering seminar)</li>
</ul>
