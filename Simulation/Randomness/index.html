<p>Stochasticity is an important aspect of reproducing reality in a simulation scenario. There are multiple ways of adding stochasticity to a simulation. They are described below.</p>

<h1 id="random-number-generation-rng">Random number generation (RNG)</h1>

<p>Sumo implements the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_twister">Mersenne Twister</a> algorithm for generating random numbers. This random number generator (RNG) is initialized with a seed value which defaults to the (arbitrary) value <strong>23423</strong>. This setup makes all applications deterministic by default as the sequence of random numbers is fixed for a given seed. The seed may be changed using the option . When using the option the seed will be chosen based on the current system time resulting in truly random behavior.</p>

<p>The simulation uses two different RNG instances, one for random numbers used on creating vehicles and one for the dynamic behavior. The reasoning behind this is that changes to the vehicles defined later in a route file should not affect the behavior of already running vehicles.</p>

<h1 id="vehicle-type-and-route-distributions">Vehicle type and route distributions</h1>

<p>The easiest way of dynamically modifying vehicle behavior is to choose the type or the route from a distribution on loading. Each type / route has to be given explicitly with an assigned probability, see <a href="/Definition_of_Vehicles,_Vehicle_Types,_and_Routes#Route_and_vehicle_type_distributions" title="wikilink">route and vehicle type distributions</a>. This gives on the one hand fine grained control of the results but on the other hand makes it hard to model something like for instance a uniform distribution of vehicle lengths between 5m and 7m.</p>

<h1 id="speed-distribution"><a href="/Definition_of_Vehicles,_Vehicle_Types,_and_Routes#Speed_Distributions" title="wikilink">Speed distribution</a></h1>

<p>By default, vehicles in SUMO adhere to the maximum speed defined for the lane they are driving on (if the maximumSpeed of their vehicle type allows it). This behavior can be modified using the -attribute which makes vehicles drive with that factor of the current speed limit. The attribute also allows the specification of the parameters of a normal distribution with optional cutoffs. The random value is selected once for each vehicle at the time of its creation. Using a speed deviation is the recommended way for getting a heterogenous mix of vehicle speeds.</p>

<h1 id="car-following">Car-Following</h1>

<p>The default <a href="/Definition_of_Vehicles,_Vehicle_Types,_and_Routes#Car-Following_Models" title="wikilink">car-following model <em>Krauss</em></a> supports stochastic driving behavior through the -attribute (default 0.5). When this value is non-zero drivers will randomly vary their speed based on the RNG described above. Other car-following models also use this attribute.</p>

<h1 id="departure-times">Departure times</h1>

<p>The departure times of all vehicles may be varied randomly by using the option . When this option is used each vehicle receives a random offset to its departure time, equidistributed on [0, ].</p>

<h1 id="flows-with-a-fixed-number-of-vehicles">Flows with a fixed number of vehicles</h1>

<p>The <a href="/DUAROUTER" title="wikilink">DUAROUTER</a>, <a href="/DFROUTER" title="wikilink">DFROUTER</a> and <a href="/JTRROUTER" title="wikilink">JTRROUTER</a> applications support the option . When this option is used, each vehicle defined by a -element will be given a random departure time which is equidistributed within the time interval of the flow. (By default vehicles of a flow are spaced equally in time).</p>

<h1 id="flows-with-a-random-number-of-vehicles">Flows with a random number of vehicles</h1>

<p>Both <a href="/DUAROUTER" title="wikilink">DUAROUTER</a> and <a href="/SUMO" title="wikilink">SUMO</a> support loading of elements with attribute . When this attribute is used (instead of , or ), a vehicle will be emitted randomly with the given probability each second. This results in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution">binomially distributed</a> flow (which approximates a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution">Poisson Distribution</a> for small probabilities. When modeling such a flow on a multi-lane road it is recommended to define a for each individual lane.</p>

<h1 id="departure-and-arrival-attributes">Departure and arrival attributes</h1>

<p>The , and elements support the value “random” for their attributes , , and . The value will be chosen randomly on every insertion try (for the departure attributes) or whenever there is a need to revalidate the arrival value (i.e. after rerouting).</p>
