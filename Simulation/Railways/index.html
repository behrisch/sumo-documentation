<h1 id="train-simulation">Train Simulation</h1>

<p>This page describes simulations of trains in SUMO. To build an intermodal simulation scenario with trains, additional steps have to be take in comparison to a plain vehicular simulation.</p>

<h1 id="approaches-to-train-modelling">Approaches to train modelling</h1>

<p>Currently, no exclusive movement model for trains is implemented. Instead the existing models for vehicle movement need to be re-purposed.</p>

<h2 id="railways">Railways</h2>

<p>Railways can be imported from <a href="/Networks/Import/OpenStreetMap" title="wikilink">OSM</a>. They can also be explicitly specified using the existing <em>vClasses</em>.</p>

<h2 id="bidirectional-track-usage">Bidirectional track usage</h2>

<p>Bidirectional track usage is modelled by two edges that have their geometries exactly reversed and using the attribute . This will result in lane geometries that are overlayed exactly. These edges are referred to as <em>superposed</em> (alternatively as bidirecticional rail edges).</p>

<p>Rail signals recognize superposed edges and automatically restrict their usage so that only one direction is accessible at a time.</p>

<p>When importing networks from <a href="/Networks/Import/OpenStreetMap" title="wikilink">OSM</a>, rails tagged with are automatically imported as superposed edges.</p>

<p><a href="/SUMO-GUI" title="wikilink">SUMO-GUI</a> automatically shows only one of both edges to avoid duplicate drawing of cross-ties. The visualisation option <em>show lane direction</em> can be used to identifiy superposed edges as arrows in both directions will be show.</p>

<p><a href="/NETEDIT" title="wikilink">NETEDIT</a> supports the visualisation option <em>spread superposed</em> which draws both edges with an offset and thus makes it easier to edit them.</p>

<h2 id="rail-signals">Rail Signals</h2>

<p>The <a href="/Networks/Building_Networks_from_own_XML-descriptions#Node_Descriptions" title="wikilink">node type</a> may be used to define signals which implement <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_block_signaling">Automatic Block Signaling</a>.</p>

<h2 id="rail-crossings">Rail Crossings</h2>

<p>The <a href="/Networks/Building_Networks_from_own_XML-descriptions#Node_Descriptions" title="wikilink">node type</a> may be used to define railway crossings. At these nodes trains will always have the right of way and road vehicles get a red light until there is a safe gap between approaching trains.</p>

<p>When importing networks from <a href="/Networks/Import/OpenStreetMap" title="wikilink">OpenStreetMap</a>, rail crossings will be imported automatically. For other input data sources the crossings may have to be specified <a href="/Tutorials/ScenarioGuide#Modifying_an_imported_network_via_plain.xml" title="wikilink">via additional xml files</a> or set via <a href="/NETEDIT" title="wikilink">NETEDIT</a> after importing.</p>
