<h1 id="emergency-vehicle-simulation">Emergency Vehicle simulation</h1>

<p>The simulation of emergency vehicles and their special rights is partially possible with SUMO. Additional capabilities are planned for the future.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Disregarding right-of-way and traffic lights: This is supported by using the <a href="/TraCI/Change_Vehicle_State#speed_mode_.280xb3.29" title="wikilink">TraCI ‘speed mode’ command</a> to disable intersection related safety checks.</li>
  <li>Exceeding the speed limit: This is supported by setting the vType-attribute <a href="/Definition_of_Vehicles,_Vehicle_Types,_and_Routes#Vehicle_Types" title="wikilink"><em>speedFactor</em></a> (a value of 1.5 allows driving with 150% of the road speed limit).</li>
  <li>Driving in a virtual middle lane on a multi-lane road: This is supported by using the <a href="/Simulation/SublaneModel" title="wikilink">sublane model</a>. The cooperative behavior of the surrounding traffic is not automatic and must be forced via TraCI commands.</li>
  <li>Overtaking on the right: This is always permitted for vehicles with</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="visualization">Visualization</h1>

<p>The visualization of emergency vehicles is supported in <a href="/SUMO-GUI" title="wikilink">SUMO-GUI</a>. When setting the vType-attribute a white vehicle with the international sign for first aid is drawn. Furthermore a police car will be drawn with vType-attribute and a firebrigade with vType-attribute . When additionally setting the vType-attribute a blue flashing light will be drawn also.</p>
