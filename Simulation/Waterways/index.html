<p>This page describes simulations of (inland) waterways in SUMO.</p>

<h1 id="approaches-to-ship-modelling">Approaches to ship modelling</h1>

<p>Currently, no exclusive movement model for ships is implemented. Instead the existing models for vehicle movement need to be re-purposed. By setting , vehicles are drawn in a more appropriate shape.</p>

<h2 id="problems-and-workarounds">Problems and workarounds</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Due to the one-way nature of edges in sumo, ships cannot overtake each other by using the whole width of the waterway. To allow overtaking, multiple lanes have to be defined.</li>
  <li>Since the right-of-way rules for ships are more complex than those for road vehicles, waterway intersections are set to by default.</li>
</ul>

<p>Waterways can be imported from <a href="/Networks/Import/OpenStreetMap" title="wikilink">OSM</a> by adding the type map <a href="http://sumo.dlr.de/trac.wsgi/browser/trunk/sumo/data/typemap/osmNetconvertShips.typ.xml">osmNetconvertShips.typ.xml</a>. They can also be explicitly specified by setting .</p>
