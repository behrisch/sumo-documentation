<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p><a href="/SUMO" title="wikilink">SUMO</a> allows to generate a large number of different measures. All write the values they collect into files or a socket connection following the common rules for <a href="/Basics/Using_the_Command_Line_Applications#Writing_files" title="wikilink">writing files</a>. Per default, all are disabled, and have to be triggered individually. Some of the available outputs (<a href="/Simulation/Output/RawDump" title="wikilink">raw vehicle positions dump</a>, <a href="/Simulation/Output/TripInfo" title="wikilink">trip information</a>, <a href="/Simulation/Output/VehRoutes" title="wikilink">vehicle routes information</a>, and <a href="/Simulation/Output/Summary" title="wikilink">simulation state statistics</a>) are triggered using command line options, the others have to be defined within s.</p>

</ul>

<h1 id="commandline-output-verbose">Commandline Output (verbose)</h1>

<p>When running the simulation with option (short ) the following data will be printed (unless explicitly disabled with option ):</p>

<h2 id="vehicle-counts">Vehicle Counts</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Inserted: number vehicles that entered the simulation network</li>
  <li>Loaded: number of vehicles that were loaded from route files. This may differ from emitted forw two reason:
    <ul>
      <li>Running with option with a value less than 1.0</li>
      <li>Having a congested network where not all vehicles could be inserted before the simulation time ended</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Running: number of vehicles currently active in the network at simulation end</li>
  <li>Waiting: number of vehicles which could not yet be inserted into the network due to congestion</li>
  <li>Teleports: number of of times that vehicles were teleported for any of the following reasons (These reasons are given whenever a teleport warning is issued)
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/Simulation/Why_Vehicles_are_teleporting#Collisions" title="wikilink">Collision</a>: a vehicle violated its minGap requirement in relation to its leader vehicle</li>
      <li><a href="/Simulation/Why_Vehicles_are_teleporting#Waiting_too_long.2C_aka_Grid-locks" title="wikilink">Timeout</a>: a vehicle was unable to move for –time-to-teleport seconds (default 300)
        <ul>
          <li>wrong lane: a vehicle was unable to move because it could not continue its route on the current lane and was unable to change to the correct lane</li>
          <li>yield: a vehicle was unable to cross an intersection where it did not have priority</li>
          <li>jam: a vehicle could not continue because there was no space on the next lane</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If the simulation contained persons the following output will be added:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Inserted: number of persons that were loaded from route files</li>
  <li>Running: number of persons active in the network at simulation end</li>
  <li>Jammed: number of times a person was jammed</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="timing-data">Timing Data</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Duration: The amount of elapsed time (as measure by a clock hanging on the wall) while computing the simulation.</li>
  <li>“Real time factor”: The quotient of <em>simulated time</em> / <em>computation time</em>. If one hour is simulated in 360 seconds the real time factor is 10.</li>
  <li>UPS: (updates per second). The number of vehicles that were simulated on average per second of computation time.</li>
</ul>

<p>If routing took place in the simulation, Each routing algorithm instance will report</p>

<ul>
  <li>The number of routing queries</li>
  <li>The number of edges that were checked in order to find the best route</li>
  <li>The total time spend routing and the average time per routing call</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="aggregated-traffic-measures">Aggregated Traffic Measures</h2>

<p>When setting the option , verbose output is automatically enabled (unless explicitly set to <em>false</em>) and the following averages for all vehicle trips will be printed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>RouteLength: average route length</li>
  <li>Duration: average trip duration</li>
  <li>WaitingTime: average time spent standing (involuntarily)</li>
  <li>TimeLoss: average time lost due to driving slower than desired (includes WaitingTime). The desired speed takes the vehicles <a href="/Definition_of_Vehicles,_Vehicle_Types,_and_Routes#Speed_Distributions" title="wikilink">speedFactor</a> into account.</li>
  <li>DepartDelay: average time vehicle departures were <a href="/Simulation/VehicleInsertion" title="wikilink">delayed due to lack of road space</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If the simulation contained pedestrians (walking persons) the following output will be added:</p>

<ul>
  <li>walks: the number of distinct -elements in the input</li>
  <li>RouteLength: average walk length</li>
  <li>Duration: average walk duration</li>
</ul>

<p>If the simulation contained passengers (persons riding in vehicles) the following output will be added:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rides: the number of distinct -elements in the input</li>
  <li>Duration: average ride duration</li>
  <li>Bus rides: number of rides with a public transport vehicle driving on roads (public transport is identified by having the <em>line</em>-attribute set).</li>
  <li>Train rides number of rides with a public transport vehicle driving on rails</li>
  <li>Bike rides: number of rides with vehicle class <em>bicycle</em></li>
  <li>Aborted rides: rides that could not be completed because no suitable vehicle was available</li>
</ul>

<p>When setting this option and using <a href="/SUMO-GUI" title="wikilink">SUMO-GUI</a>, the network parameter dialog will also show a running average for these traffic measures (The dialog is accessible by right-clicking on the network background).</p>
