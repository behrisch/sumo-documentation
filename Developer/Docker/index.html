<h2 id="dockerised-sumo">Dockerised SUMO</h2>

<p>Building and installing SUMO from source is not an easy task for beginner users. Docker is a popular tool to solve this issue. Searching “SUMO” at <a href="https://hub.docker.com">Docker Hub</a> will give several results from attempts to Dockerise SUMO. We list a few of these attempts beginning with standalone SUMO to SUMO with other packages.</p>

<h3 id="sumo-sumo-gui-and-traci">SUMO, SUMO GUI, and TraCI</h3>

<p>The solution given at <a href="https://github.com/bogaotory/docker-sumo">docker-sumo</a> contains only standard SUMO and tools. It demonstrates how to Dockerise SUMO version 0.30.0 on top of Ubuntu 16.04. As well as sumo and TraCI, <a href="https://github.com/bogaotory/docker-sumo">docker-sumo</a> also shows the user how to access the graphical interface of a Dockerised SUMO, i.e. <strong>sumo-gui</strong>, which is unique compared to other attempts at Dockerising SUMO.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/similitude/sumo-docker/">sumo-docker</a> project demonstrates how to Dockerise SUMO version 0.25.0 on top of Apache Mavern 3 with <a href="https://github.com/egueli/TraCI4J">TraCI4J</a>.</p>

<h3 id="sumo-and-jupedsim">SUMO and JuPedSim</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/grgrlmml/hybrid_sumo_jps/">hybrid_sumo_jps</a> project aims on providing an easy to use docker image for running a hybrid simulation that couples SUMO with <a href="http://www.jupedsim.org">JuPedSim</a>. SUMO is a mighty simulator for all kinds of transport problems that focuses mainly on motorized traffic. While SUMO also provides a pedestrian model for simulating pedestrians on sidewalks, crossings or the like, it lacks of the capability to model pedestrians in true 2d space (e.g. in buildings, on squares, at train stations). Instead of reinventing the wheel we decided to team up with JuPedSim and develop a hybrid coupling approach that combines the power of both frameworks. The coupling is realized using google’s <a href="https://github.com/google/protobuf">rotocol buffers</a> over <a href="https://github.com/grpc">gRPC</a>, a library for *remote procedure calls*. Currently this coupling approach is provided as a Docker image. Moreover, also the Docker image is not intended to replace the common SUMO installation (e.g. hybrid_sumo_jps does not provided a graphical interface, i.e. no sumo-gui), you may also use the hybrid_sumo_jps image to run ordinary SUMO scenarios.</p>

<p>Details on how to run hybrid_sumo_jps can be found at the corresponding <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/grgrlmml/hybrid_sumo_jps/">hybrid_sumo_jps’s Docker Hub</a> page.</p>
